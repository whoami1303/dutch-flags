Because of the central position of Assen and the fact that the government from what was then called de Landschap Drenthe (the Landscape Drenthe) was searching for a location for the government and civil servants, Assen became the seat for, and thus practically also the capital of Drenthe.",

The 'boezelschup' (peat-digger) refers to the marshes, the 'hunebed' (passage-grave) to the sand. The 'boezelschup' has a specific form, only used in southeast Drenthe, and was used to divide mud evenly. The golden color refers to it being a wooden spade. In the municipality is the 'Nationaal Hunebeddeninformatiecentrum', as well as 18 'hunebedden', spread over both former municipalities, more than in any other municipality. Both municipalities were mainly agricultural. So horses were chosen as supporters, which also refers to present day use of horses in sports (the Hippic center in Exloo, riding-school in Bronneger).",

Four of them feature official district or borough offices. Furthermore, it also comprises the unofficial historic district and neighborhood Oostvaardersdiep. Almere is part of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (MRA). Almere is the newest city in the Netherlands: the land on which the city sits, the Southern Flevoland polder, was reclaimed from the IJsselmeer from 1959 to 1968. The first house was finished in 1976, and Almere became a municipality in 1984. It has the largest population of the municipalities in Flevoland with 214,715 citizens in 2021 and the 8th largest in the Netherlands. In October 2007, the city council of Almere made agreements with the government to expand the city to 350,000 inhabitants by 2030",

The arms of the municipalities of Wieringermeer and the Noordoostpolder do contain the arms of Minister Lely as well. The lower half of the shield, executed in gold, has as central element a mooring-mast, in connection to the cultural center 'De Meerpaal' in Dronten, and the connevtion between it and the municipality. Around the mooring-mast is a big red ring, to which two smaller ones have been connected, symbolizing the places Dronten, Biddinghuizen, and Swifterbant. To underline the large area of the municipality supporters have been added. Because the interest in horses in the municipality is great it was found fitting to use two of them as supporters.",
