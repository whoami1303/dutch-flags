Because of the central position of Assen and the fact that the government from what was then called de Landschap Drenthe (the Landscape Drenthe) was searching for a location for the government and civil servants, Assen became the seat for, and thus practically also the capital of Drenthe.",

The 'boezelschup' (peat-digger) refers to the marshes, the 'hunebed' (passage-grave) to the sand. The 'boezelschup' has a specific form, only used in southeast Drenthe, and was used to divide mud evenly. The golden color refers to it being a wooden spade. In the municipality is the 'Nationaal Hunebeddeninformatiecentrum', as well as 18 'hunebedden', spread over both former municipalities, more than in any other municipality. Both municipalities were mainly agricultural. So horses were chosen as supporters, which also refers to present day use of horses in sports (the Hippic center in Exloo, riding-school in Bronneger).",
